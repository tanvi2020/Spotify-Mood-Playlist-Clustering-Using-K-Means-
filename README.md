# 🎧 Spotify Mood Playlist Clustering using K-Means (from Scratch)

## 📌 Motivation

With millions of tracks available on streaming platforms like Spotify, users often struggle to discover songs that match their mood or activity. Can we build a system that clusters music based on emotional "vibe" using only audio features?

This project explores how **unsupervised learning** — specifically **K-Means clustering** — can be used to automatically group songs into **mood-based playlists**, without any labeled data.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a mood-based playlist recommendation engine by:

- Clustering songs using audio features like **energy, danceability, valence, tempo**, etc.
- Implementing **K-Means from scratch** (no built-in ML libraries like `sklearn`)
- Interpreting clusters based on mood and use-cases for **automated playlist creation**

---

## 🎶 Why Spotify?

-  **80+ million tracks** are available for streaming
-  Music plays a major role in regulating mood, focus, and productivity
-  Listeners often seek **vibe-based playlists** (e.g., chill, workout, party)
-  Spotify provides rich **numerical audio features** suitable for clustering

## 🔄 Project Flow

1.  **Data Collection**  
   Dataset of ~10,000 Spotify tracks with features from Kaggle

2.  **EDA & Visualization**  
   - Distribution plots of loudness, energy, acousticness, etc.  
   - Correlation heatmap to explore relationships

3.  **Feature Scaling**  
   - Standardized features to avoid bias in clustering  
   - Used MinMax or Z-score scaling

4.  **Elbow Method**  
   - Plotted inertia to determine optimal `k`  
   - Identified the "elbow" point

5.  **K-Means Clustering (from Scratch)**  
   - Random centroid initialization  
   - Assignment based on Euclidean distance  
   - Iterative update of centroids until convergence

6.  **Cluster Visualization**  
   - 2D plots (PCA-reduced) showing mood clusters  
   - Compared high-energy/danceable vs. low-tempo/acoustic songs

7.  **Business Use Case**  
   - Each cluster = mood-based playlist  
   - Potential application in **automated playlist generation** for music apps
